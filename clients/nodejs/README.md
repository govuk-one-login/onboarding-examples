# Example GOV.UK One Login relying party client in Typescript

> [!WARNING]
> This is intended as a example and is not production quality code.

An example [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) application using GOV.UK One Login to authentication and identity.

Works with the:

- [GOV.UK One Login Simulator](https://github.com/govuk-one-login/simulator) 
which is preconfigured to allow authentication and identity journeys.
- [GOV.UK One Login integration environment](https://docs.sign-in.service.gov.uk/before-integrating/register-and-manage-your-service/) which requires you use the [GOV.UK One Login admin tool](https://admin.sign-in.service.gov.uk/register/enter-email-address) to create configuration and that you update your `.env.integration` configuration file with the Client ID and Public Key.
